# HRI SlimeArt: SlimeBot

SlimeArt is a generative art tool for artists to create dynamic pieces out of an agent-based algorithm modeled after the emergent behavior of slime mold.  HRI SlimeArt is the experimental condition of SlimeArt for Leila Takayama's Human-Robot Interaction course at UCSC during the Spring of 2021.  SlimeBot provides encouragement and tips to the artist while they create with SlimeArt.



To download an executable of the application, select from the resolution options in the executables folder. Unfortunately, SlimeArt works exclusively on Windows machines due to its dependency on compute shaders.
